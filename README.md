### üìö About

Embark on a project where we implement the A* search algorithm to tackle the Sokoban game:

- **Project Scope**: Introduce and optimize the A* search algorithm for solving Sokoban puzzles.
- **Heuristic Design**: Develop a novel heuristic function, Q*, and benchmark its performance against the default heuristic function and the UCS algorithm.
- **Optimality vs. Speed**: Explore the delicate balance between heuristic optimality and computational efficiency.
- **Innovative Solutions**: Propose heuristic designs that ensure optimal solutions across various Sokoban maps without compromising search speed.

### üé• Show-off

- [x] Watch the Video: [A* and Sokoban Game - Heuristic is a piece of cake! - [AI course - CS106 - UIT]](https://youtu.be/wp_hpPnzQHg?feature=shared)

# üìÅ Repo Structure

- **RESOURCES**: Contains project guidelines, documents, and reports.
- **SOURCE CODE**: Includes the implementation code of the project.
- [x] OneDrive Backup: [Astar_Heuristic_for_Sokoban_Game](https://uithcm-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/22521178_ms_uit_edu_vn/EtPMjp9oBZJOs-FB7S_2BhYBKIJ0Dz2M3XlWftQCxivsCA?e=rn6OCR) - Backup of the project files.

# üöÄ Pipeline

- Implementation of UCS and A* algorithms with detailed guides.
- Utilization of hardware resources: ASUS ViVoBook, Intel i5 core, 12GB RAM for experiments.
- Presentation of comprehensive project reports.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Install This Project

- Download all source code and run `Sokoban.py` to play the game.
- Modify configurations in `constants.py` for project customization.
- Organized as an MVC model: View (`Sokoban.py`) and Controller (`Game.py`).
- Modify algorithms in `solver.py` under `auto_move()`.

### üîß Requirements

- Python >= 3.0
- pygame
- pyautogui
