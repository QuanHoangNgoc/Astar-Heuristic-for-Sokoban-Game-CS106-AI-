### about 
- In this project, we install an A* search algorithm to apply it to solve the Sokoban game.
- We design a new heuristic function for the A* algorithm and make a benchmark to evaluate its performance with the default heuristic function as well as the UCS algorithm. 
- The most important thing in the A* algorithm is designed to be a good heuristic function. There is a tradeoff between optimality and speed when designing heuristic functions.
- We also presented various ideas for the design heuristic function, where the heuristic function Q* that we proposed can find optimal solutions in all maps while the search time is not significant.
